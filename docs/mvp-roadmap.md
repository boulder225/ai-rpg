## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
*Core AI Agent Infrastructure*

### Detailed Monthly Breakdown

### AI Agent Deliverables
- **Basic AI GM System**: Single-session game orchestration with autonomous decision-making
  - *Example*: "The tavern keeper notices your bloodied armor. Roll for Charisma to avoid suspicion."
- **Simple NPC Framework**: 5-10 character archetypes with personality-driven dialogue
  - *Tavern Keeper*: Gruff → Friendly → Helpful (based on player reputation)
  - *Village Guard*: Suspicious → Neutral → Trusting (based on quest completion)

- **Monster AI Core**: Combat behavior patterns for 3-5 creature types
  - *Goblin*: Pack tactics, proximity detection, flee at 25% health
  - *Orc*: Aggressive rush, environmental awareness, weapon adaptation
  - *Dragon*: Territorial defense, breath weapon timing, player threat assessment
- **Command Recognition**: Text-based interface with natural language processing
  - Commands: /attack, /talk, /examine, /inventory, /cast [spell]

### Success Criteria
- AI GM can run 30-minute sessions without human intervention
- NPCs respond contextually to player actions with personality consistency
- Monster encounters demonstrate tactical intelligence and proximity awareness
- 95% uptime for core AI systems
- User can engage in meaningful conversations with autonomous agents
